âœ¨ I am a front-end developer with a background in graphic design. Beyond enjoying implementing my designs into interactive applications, I am passionate about initiating and taking part in projects that have some form of social impact. Being able to identify a need and translate it into a simple solution is the most rewarding aspect of both careers.
