I am a front-end developer with a background in graphic design. Beyond enjoying implementing my designs into interactive applications, I am passionate about initiating and taking part in projects that have some form of social impact. Being able to identify a need and translate it into a simple solution is the most rewarding aspect of both careers.

I love gaining insights from different perspectives and constantly challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone. People who know me are aware that I am always looking to try new things and engage in physical activities that represent a challenge. For example, I cannot swim, but it didn't stop me from practicing surf or going canoeing in a turbulent river.
